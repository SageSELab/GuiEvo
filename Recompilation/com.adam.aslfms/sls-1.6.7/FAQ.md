To ask a question about Simple Last.fm Scrobbler (SLS), please use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/simple-last-fm-scrobbler/sls) or [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/592703275837685760).

## What is Last.fm?
A site for music discovery, exploration, socialization, etc. And you can listen to music too!
Visit [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm), or see their [FAQ](http://www.last.fm/help/faq).

## Is this a music player?
No, this is a scrobbler, which means that it submits information to Last.fm on what music you listen to. Then you can view your listening history and other statistics (plus much, much more) on your Last.fm profile page.

## What's new in version XX?
See [the changelog](https://github.com/simple-last-fm-scrobbler/sls/blob/master/assets/changelog.txt) for a list of changes.

## How to enable scrobbling in a music app
For any scrobbling to work, you first have to enter your Last.fm (or Libre.fm) account details into SLS and authenticate. When you've done that, each specific music player might require you to enable scrobbling in their settings. Some players, such as the default players on most phones, work right out-of-the-box.

## Please support app YY
I'm always looking for new apps to support, but almost always it requires some work on their end as well. Be assured though, the list of supported apps will grow. (If you are a developer, see [Compatibility.md](Compatability.md)).

But if there is no issue for your app here on the GitHub page, email me or create the issue yourself and I'll get right on it (as soon as I get the time...).

## Where do I get the ListenBrainz token?
The user token for ListenBrainz is shown in your user profile, at https://listenbrainz.org/profile/.
